# useReducer ðŸ¦–
 
> Notes: 
- useReducer may be used as an alternative to useState. 
- Ideal for complex state logic  where there's a dependency on previous state values or *lotta* sub values
- depending on your use case you may find useReducer to be more testable 
- Below's a one-stop reference for useReducer. A cheatsheet with live editable examples.    
[View docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) 

## Basic Usage  
<Editor noInline code={BasicExample}/>

## Initialize State Lazily 
`useReducer` takes a third function parameter. This function will be called with  
`initialState` - the second parameter. You may initialize state from this function. 
Whatever's returned from this function is returned as the state object.

<Editor noInline code={InitLazy}/>


## Imitate this.setState's behaviour 
`useReducer` uses a reducer that isn't as strict as Redux's e.g. the second parameter passed 
to the reducer, `action` doesn't have to have a `type` property. 
This allows for interesting manipulations such as renaming the parameter and doing the following: 

<Editor noInline code={ImitateSetState}/>

<!-- todo: usecase where no re-renders when
useReducer returns the same state object -->
