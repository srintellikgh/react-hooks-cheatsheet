> Ideas for sharing: 
- Hooks have a simple API and you can view them with live editable examples here. 
- Here's a one-stop reference for hooks. A cheatsheet with live editable examples. 

## Declare State Variable 
<Editor code={DeclareStateVar}/>

## Update State Variable
<Editor code={UpdateStateVar} />

## Multiple State Variables 
<Editor code={MultipleStateVars} />

## Use Object State Variable
You have to pass the entire object to the `useState` updater function as the object is replaced NOT merged. 
<Editor code={StateObject} />

## Initialize State from Function 
<Editor code={StateFromFn} />
