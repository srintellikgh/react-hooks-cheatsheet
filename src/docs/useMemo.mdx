# useMemo ðŸŽ’

> Notes:
 - useMemo returns a memoized value
 - [View docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)

## Starter Example

<Editor noInline code={Starter} />

The example above is similar to the one for `useCallback`. The only difference here
is that `someValue` is an object NOT a string. Owing to this, the `Instructions`
component still re-renders. Why? Objects are compared by reference, and the reference changes
whenever `<App />` re-renders.

Any solutions?

## Basic Usage

The object, `someValue` may be memoized using `useMemo`. This prevents the needless re-render.

<Editor noInline code={Basic} />
