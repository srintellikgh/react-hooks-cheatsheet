# useCallback 👁

> `useCallback` returns a [memoized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) callback. [View Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback)

## Basic Example

<Editor noInline code={Starter} />

Note in the example above that the parent component, `<Age />` is updated (and re-rendered) whenever there's
an update to age i.e when you click the "Get older" button.
Owing to that, the `<Instructions />` child component is also re-rendered because the `doSomething` prop is passed a
new callback, with a new reference.

> NB: Even though the `Instructions` child component uses React.memo to optimize performace, it is still re-rendered.

How can this be fixed? i.e prevent `<Instructions />` from re-rendering needlessly?

## useCallback with referenced function

<Editor noInline code={ReferencedFn} />

## useCallback with inline function

<Editor noInline code={InlineFn} />
`useCallback` works with an inline function as well.
