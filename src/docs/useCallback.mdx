# useCallback 👁

> Say something sensible, and add link to doc

## Basic Example to be refactored

<Editor noInline code={StarterExample} />

Note in the example above that the parent component, `<Age />` is updated (and re-rendered) whenever there's
an update to age i.e when you click the "Get older" button.
Owing to that, the `<Instructions />` component is also re-rendered because the `doSomething` prop is passed a
new callback, with a new reference.

How can this be fixed? i.e prevent `<Instructions />` from re-rendering needlessly?

## useCallback with inline function

## useCallback with referenced function
